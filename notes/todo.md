## improvements

- [ ] complete workflow + output files description for pileup.
- [ ] numpy array with insertion/clips density/number/length.
- [x] small rule to extract stats on how many (and what fraction of) primary/secondary reads are on each reference (and across references).

- plots
  - [ ] statistics on read lengths.
  - [ ] statistics on coverage.
  - [ ] coverage plot -> adapt interval and binning.
  - [ ] Plot for secondary/supplementary reads on the reference over time.
